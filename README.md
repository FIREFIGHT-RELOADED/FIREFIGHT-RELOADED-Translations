# FIREFIGHT RELOADED Translations
The official FIREFIGHT RELOADED translation project. All translations will be manually reviewed before they are merged into FIREFIGHT RELOADED. Any strings deemed malicious will have strings reverted back to English. Do not use any machine-translation service or AI. Translations will be reviewed and/or approved before the release of an update. More info below.

Translations will have 2 phases of approval:
1. They will be merged into the main repo at 100% to save and preserve the language throughout development. They don't get added into the beta branches until the update reaches the finalization stage, within a month or so from planned release date. 
2. Upon the finalization stage of a new update, the finished languages will be reviewed and get added into the mod. If any problematic language string/s are found or anything that violates the rules above, they will be removed and the language won't be added into the mod until the string/s are fixed.

DO NOT USE GitLocalize's MACHINE TRANSLATION SERVICE AS IT WILL RESULT IN THE LANGUAGE GETTING RESET AS IT WILL VIOLATE THE ABOVE RULES.

NOTE: For Chinese translators: GitLocalize doesn't have Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese specifically, so it is set up slightly wierdly here: 
 
- "Chinese, China" is zh_Hant (Traditional Chinese).
- "Chinese" is zh_Hans (Simplified Chinese).
